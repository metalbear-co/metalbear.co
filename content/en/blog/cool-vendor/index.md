  MetalBear has been recognized as a Cool Vendor in Gartner's 2025 Container Management report for mirrord, our tool that solves cloud native development friction. mirrord allows developers to run code locally while mirroring traffic and services from remote Kubernetes clusters, enabling production-like testing without deployment overhead. This recognition validates our mission to help teams ship features faster with lower cloud costs and reduced platform team burden.

As more teams go all in on Kubernetes and cloud native, the friction of building and testing cloud apps is slowing developers down. At MetalBear, we saw this problem early on, and it’s exactly why we built mirrord. Today we’re very happy to share that we’ve been recognized as a *Cool Vendor* in Gartner’s 2025 Cool Vendors report in the Container Management category$^1$. 

# What makes mirrord cool?

Most engineering teams struggle with the cost and friction of cloud native development. Until now, there have not been any good options that let developers test in production-like conditions without long wait times, while also avoiding extra burden on platform teams and rising cloud spend for organizations. 

mirrord solves this problem. It allows developers to run their code locally while seamlessly mirroring traffic, environment variables, and services from a remote Kubernetes cluster. This gives developers the realism of testing inside a production-like environment without the overhead of actually deploying code. It also allows multiple developers to safely share a cluster for development, reducing cloud costs and the management burden on platform teams.

We believe this recognition by Gartner validates the direction we’ve been pursuing since day one: helping organizations remove bottlenecks in cloud development so their teams can ship features faster, stay ahead of competitors, and do so with lower cloud costs.

# **The road ahead**

As Kubernetes adoption continues to accelerate, the demand for efficient, production-like development workflows will only grow. We are committed to meeting that demand by expanding mirrord’s capabilities, from database branching to mirrord for CI and AI-driven testing. By giving teams a way to move faster without ballooning costs or unnecessary complexity, this recognition reinforces our belief that mirrord is helping shape the future of cloud development.

We also want to take a moment to thank the mirrord community. mirrord wouldn’t be where it is today without the engineers who adopted it early, shared feedback, and helped us refine the product. Thank you for your trust and support!

Developers can get started with mirrord today by visiting metalbear.com/mirrord or exploring the open-source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord).
