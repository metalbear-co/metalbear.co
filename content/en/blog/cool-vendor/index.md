  MetalBear has been recognized as a Cool Vendor in Gartner's 2025 Container Management report for mirrord, our tool that solves cloud native development friction. mirrord allows developers to run code locally while mirroring traffic and services from remote Kubernetes clusters, enabling production-like testing without deployment overhead. This recognition validates our mission to help teams ship features faster with lower cloud costs and reduced platform team burden.

As cloud architectures become more complex, it becomes imperative to solve the slow process of building software for the cloud. This is not a new problem, and many companies tried to solve it before, but at MetalBear we found the way to do it in building [mirrord](https://metalbear.com/mirrord/), and our community and customers agree. Today we’re very happy to share that we’ve been recognized as a Cool Vendor in the 2025 Gartner Cool Vendors in Container Management report[^1].

## What makes mirrord cool?

No engineer writing software for the cloud is happy with their development process. Because production environments have grown so complex, we have lost the ability to run copies of them locally, and getting new code to production has become a stop-start marathon of builds, CI and deployments to various testing environments. Older developers yearn for the days when you could just hit F5 and debug your code in your IDE.

Which is exactly what mirrord lets you do. It allows developers to run their code locally while seamlessly mirroring traffic, environment variables, and services from a remote Kubernetes cluster. This gives developers the realism of testing inside a production-like environment without the overhead of actually deploying code. It also allows multiple developers to safely share a cluster for development, eliminating the bottleneck on shared staging environments, and allowing organizations to save cloud costs by consolidating multiple testing clusters.

We believe this recognition by Gartner validates the direction we’ve been pursuing since day one: helping organizations remove bottlenecks in cloud development so their teams can ship features faster, stay ahead of competitors, and do so with lower cloud costs.

## The road ahead

As Kubernetes adoption continues to accelerate, the demand for efficient, production-like development workflows will only grow. We are committed to meeting that demand by expanding mirrord’s capabilities, from database branching to mirrord for CI and AI-driven testing. By giving teams a way to move faster without ballooning costs or unnecessary complexity, this recognition reinforces our belief that mirrord is helping shape the future of cloud development.

We also want to take a moment to thank the mirrord community. mirrord wouldn’t be where it is today without the engineers who adopted it early, shared feedback, and helped us refine the product. Thank you for your trust and support!

Developers can get started with mirrord today by visiting [metalbear.com/mirrord](https://metalbear.com/mirrord) or exploring the open-source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord).
