KubeCon is one of those huge events where so much is happening, and so much is happening at the same time. If you don't
plan in advance, you're very likely to miss out on some events that would have been interesting for you. Our first tip
is: don’t worry too much about missing talks, as all talks will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube shortly after the
event. Social events, workshops, discussions etc. cannot be caught up later.

To help you make the most out of this year's KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America, we created four complete schedules
for four different types of attendees. Beside selected talks, these schedules also include recommendations for other
activities in and outside the conference venue. Identify the type, or types of attendees that most apply to you, and
jump to their schedule. There you’ll find our recommendations you can build your final schedule around.

The full event schedule is available on [Sched](https://sched.co/1qT7x). You can sign up and save items to your Sched
account. The schedules below include links to the items they refer to. Additionally, at the end of each type's schedule,
we linked the Sched-profile of that type.

## KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Attendees: The Archetypes

### The Newbie

Your company just started using K8s and is sending you there to see what's what, or you're a student that got a free
ticket and are new to the cloud native world, or maybe you just love technology and want to add Kuberenetes and
microservice architectures to your repertoire. Either way - you haven’t yet used Kubernetes heavily and confidently in
production, but you want to get there.

KubeCon + CloudNativeCon is not a place for learning Kubernetes from scratch - but there is enough beginner level
content. If you’re very excited about this new thing you’re just starting to understand, this conference will be like a
theme park for you. If you’re still skeptical, KubeCon + CloudNativeCon will probably make you very excited about cloud
native software and Kubernetes.

Jump directly to [The Newbie’s Schedule for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon](#the-newbies-schedule-for-kubecon--cloudnativecon)
for a schedule that takes you on a tour through the basic cloud native landscape, reinforces understanding of Kubernetes
concepts, and steers clear of talks that are sure to be irrelevant and confuse you.

### The SRE
You’re an SRE, or in a DevOps team, or just a DevOps enthusiast. Your role is not to develop applications, but to ensure
their stability.

Jump directly to [The SRE’s Schedule for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon](#the-sres-schedule-for-kubecon--cloudnativecon) for
a schedule that focuses on SRE and DevOps topics.

### The AI Fan
You somehow managed to remain enthusiastic about artificial intelligence. You don’t get a strong urge to yell
“unsubscribe” when you hear the words “AI-powered”. Your company trains models on Kubernetes. You’re building
infrastructure for AI, and you’re open to using AI in your work.
Jump directly to
[The AI Fan's Schedule for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon](#the-ai-fanss-schedule-for-kubecon--cloudnativecon) for
a schedule so artificially intelligent it's ridiculous.

### The Platforms Enjoyer
Maybe you’re a platform engineer. Maybe you’re a DevOps person that really wants to bring developer platforms to your
organization. Perhaps there is a decision to be made (should we develop a platform? Should we buy one? Which one?). We
selected the best platforms content for you, so jump directly to [The Platforms Enjoyer’s Schedule for KubeCon +
CloudNativeCon](#the-platform-enjoyers-schedule-for-kubecon--cloudnativecon) for a golden path through the conference.

#### Monday, November 11

**Any time between 08:00am to 05:00pm:**
[go pick up your badge](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1iGUa/badge-pick-up?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no).
Tuesday already has some interesting schedule items for you - so if you're already in town, go to the venue, pick up
your badge, take a quick look around, and that way you can enter the venue much quicker through a faster queue on
Tuesday.

#### Tuesday, November 12

**09:00am:**
[Project Lightning Talk: Opening + Welcome - Jorge Castro, CNCF](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1iW87/project-lightning-talk-opening-welcome-jorge-castro-cncf)
If you’re not planning on listening to all the lightning talks, try to get a seat close to the sides or the back of the
room so that you’re able to exit quickly during the very short breaks between the lightning talks.

**09:07am:**
[Welcome and Introduction: A Hitchhiker's Guide to the CNCF Landscape - Katherine Druckman and Lori Lorusso, CNCF 
Ambassador](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1iW8A/welcome-and-introduction-a-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-cncf-landscape-katherine-druckman-and-lori-lorusso-cncf-ambassador) -
Don’t expect to immediately understand every project you hear about in this lighting talk, but it’s a good opportunity
to get introduced to many projects in a short time, get a better image of the landscape, and find projects that are
interesting to you.

**09:25am:** If you have an All Access Pass, head over to
[Navigating the No-Code to Full-Code Spectrum - a Platform Engineering Journey - Jared Watts, Upbound & Maximilian Blatt, Accenture](https://sched.co/1izpd),
to hear about various developer platforms.

**09:50am:** Get some water, walk around the venue and get an idea of where everything is. Once you’re ready to hear 
some more talks, head back to hear some
[project lightning talks](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/type/Project+Opportunities/Project+Lightning+Talk)

**11:15am:** requires All Access Pass:
[Event Discovery for Kubernetes Applications - Pierangelo Di Pilato & Christoph Stäbler, Red Hat](https://colocatedeventsna2024.sched.com/event/1izqd/event-discovery-for-kubernetes-applications-pierangelo-di-pilato-christoph-stabler-red-hat)
For the rest of the day, we recommend you stay with
the [project lightning talks](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/type/Project+Opportunities/Project+Lightning+Talk) and
the [lightning talks](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/type/%E2%9A%A1+Lightning+Talks), as most of the talks in the
co-located events are more specialized so will probably be less relevant and helpful for newbies.

**11:40am** [Lunch Break](https://sched.co/1j1Va) (might require an *All Access Pass*)

**05:30pm:** [Evening Reception (Salt Palace)](https://sched.co/1jSZV) - Only for the co-located events (requires an
*All Access Pass*).

After a long day of hearing talks and talking shop, head over to one of the parties happening that night, like:

**06:30pm:**
[Kick Off Party Hosted by Harness](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1owI3/kick-off-party-hosted-by-harness?iframe=no)
to attend this one you have to have registered to it during your KubeCon + CloudNativeCon registration. If you don’t
remember if you registered - check your registration confirmation email, it will appear in there if you did.

**07:00pm:** [The House Of Kube](https://www.houseofkube.com/) - space is limited so you have to RSVP on their 
website in order to attend.

#### Wednesday, November 13
**06:50am:**
[Self-Led Morning Run Sponsored by Sonatype](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1oUEm/self-led-morning-run-sponsored-by-sonatype) -
go on a morning run before starting the next conference day. Recommended only for people staying close to the venue.
Otherwise, the way back to your accommodation for a shower and a change of clothes is probably not worth it, and you’d
also not make it in time for the opening remarks.

**09:00am:** [Keynote: Welcome + Opening Remarks - Priyanka Sharma, Executive Director, CNCF; Chris Aniszczyk, CTO, 
CNCF; Joanna Lee, VP of Legal and Strategic Programs, CNCF; Jim Zemlin, Executive Director, The Linux Foundation](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1iCMn/keynote-welcome-opening-remarks-priyanka-sharma-executive-director-cncf-chris-aniszczyk-cto-cncf-joanna-lee-vp-of-legal-and-strategic-programs-cncf-jim-zemlin-executive-director-the-linux-foundation)
The opening remarks might include some helpful orientation messages, so make sure to be there for that, as it could help
you make more out of the rest of the conference.
Note that keynotes, especially on the first day, fill up very early. So if you want to get in you have to be early, and
if you want to sit anywhere near the stage, you have to be very early.

After that we recommend staying at the rest of this morning’s keynote talks for as long as your attention span and
concentration abilities allow.

**10:30am:** If you’re a student, definitely go
to [Student Community Gathering](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1peia/student-community-gathering) to meet people
your age, make some conference friends, and get some relevant information and tips from other students.

**10:45am** (or when you’re done at the Student Community Gathering): Now
the [Solutions Showcase](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1iGWJ/solutions-showcase) (that’s the area with the sponsor
booths, coffee, and other fun stuff) is open. So head over to that area, and obviously come directly
to [our booth](#our-booth) first, #R51. Say hi, let us know if this schedule is helpful, ask us any questions you might
have about [mirrord](/mirrord), and secure some nice swag before the good stuff is gone.

#### Tuesday, November 12
On this day, the conference doesn’t really fully begin yet. There are
the [co-hosted and co-located events](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/type/CNCF-hosted+Co-located+Events?iframe=no), and
there are lightning talks.

The first thing you’ll have to do
is [pick up your badge](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/2024-11-12/overview/type/Registration/?iframe=no).
Note that multiple co-located events start at 9am, and so do the lightning project talks. So the closer to that time you
go, the longer you’ll probably have to wait in line. If you want to be sure you can make it to events starting at 9am,
you
can [pick up your badge the day before](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/2024-11-11/overview/type/Registration/?iframe=no)

You’ll probably find the most interesting talks for you on this day in
the [Observability Day](https://colocatedeventsna2024.sched.com/overview/type/Observability+Day) (requires an All Access
Pass!), though
some [project lightning talks](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/type/Project+Opportunities/Project+Lightning+Talk?iframe=no)
and [lightning talks](https://kccncna2024.sched.com/type/%E2%9A%A1+Lightning+Talks?iframe=no) will certainly be
interesting as well.
