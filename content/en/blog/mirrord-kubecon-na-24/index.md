We get it—“Another blog about a company’s KubeCon booth?” These posts can be a bit predictable. So, we’ll keep this one brief and focused on how [mirrord](https://mirrord.dev/) can actually make cloud development easier.

As one CTO put it, “*at our company, mirrord is doing as much for developer productivity as AI is*.” That’s high praise, and while we’re not here to boast, we do think it’s worth checking out if you’re looking for a smoother development process. 

If you’ve ever found yourself going to the kitchen for your fifth cup of coffee that day as you wait for yet another CI run, we might have a solution for you.

## Why stop by Booth #R51

Here’s why we’re excited to be at KubeCon and why Booth #R51 might be worth a visit:

### 1.  mirrord can completely transform your cloud development workflow
By making the [staging environment immediately usable](https://mirrord.dev/docs/using-mirrord/) from the first step of the development cycle, we’ve seen mirrord dramatically increase developer velocity, reduce onboarding times for new teammates, and generally make everyone in the R&D just a little bit happier—and we want you to feel the impact yourself. 

As one engineer put it, *“This is a huge time saving boon for full stack & BE developers and helps us deliver a better product because we’re able to test end-to-end changes before code submission.”*

Now, we know the word “transform” might sound like a six-month project with our team camped out in your office. But **mirrord isn’t just a great tool—it’s self-serve and quick to set up**. Don’t believe us? Bring your laptop to Booth #R51 and see for yourself. We’ll have you up and running with your local dev environment fully integrated with your staging setup in less than 60 minutes.

Come by the booth for:

* **Live demos**. We’ll demonstrate how you can code, test, and debug with mirrord—seamlessly connecting your local setup to the cloud.
* **A look at our [new Queue Splitting feature](https://mirrord.dev/docs/using-mirrord/queue-splitting/)**. Picture this—multiple developers testing the same queue-based service on their staging environment at once, without conflicts. This utopian fantasy is made reality by the new queue splitting feature, which lets mirrord split incoming messages from remote queues like AWS SQS and Kafka between your local processes and the cloud.
* **A space to share your Kubernetes frustrations** with a team that truly understands (and can do something about it). We’re here to listen and improve based on your needs—whether it’s new features, tweaks, or simply understanding your workflow better.


### 2. Help us make mirrord even better
We’re here to learn. We genuinely want to understand your pain points. The more we grasp your blockers and frustrations, the better we can build mirrord to address them.

A bunch of our devs are going to be at the booth. Come chat with us about the problems you face in cloud development, and we’ll either have a solution or take it back to the drawing board. 

### 3. Oh, and there’s swag

It’s our first conference booth, so we’ve brain-dumped two years of swag ideas on it. We’ve got customized sleep masks (if you booked the same flights to Utah as us, you’ll need them), stress balls for when things get chaotic, and T-shirts and stickers to show off your new favorite dev tool 😉.

We’ve also got a few surprises up our sleeves. But to find out, you’ll have to stop by Booth #R51.

So, if you’ve already figured out a solution for the convoluted nightmare that is developing cloud microservices, feel free to pass on our booth. But **if you’re looking to speed things up and ship more, come see us at Booth #R51 - and we’ll get you sorted**. 

See you in Salt Lake City! Look for the light purple booth—we’ll be there, ready to make cloud development a whole lot simpler.
