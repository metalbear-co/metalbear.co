‚ÄúIs mirrord some kind of ptrace magic?‚Äù, that‚Äôs what I exactly thought when I was introduced to this idea of ‚Äúmirroring traffic‚Äù. But to my surprise, the idea and design behind mirrord are completely out of the box! And this is what I want to discuss in the blog post along with my experience as a student learning how to tackle bugs working on this badass project.

## Recap ‚è™

mirrord lets you run a local process in the context of a cloud service, which means we can test our code on staging, without actually deploying it there. This leads to shorter feedback loops (you don‚Äôt have to wait on long CI processes to test your code in staging conditions) and a more stable staging environment (since untested services aren‚Äôt being deployed there). There is a detailed overview of mirrord and what we strive to achieve with it in [this](https://metalbear.co/blog/reintroducing-mirrord/) blog post.

## mirrord-layer + LD_PRELOAD = ‚ù§Ô∏è

mirrord-layer, shipped as a dynamic library, is responsible for ‚Äúoverriding‚Äù or ‚Äúhooking‚Äù libc functions through `LD_PRELOAD`.

### What is `LD_PRELOAD`?

`LD_PRELOAD`, available as an environment variable, is a feature provided by dynamic linkers like ldd that allows us to load our shared library i.e. mirrord-layer, in this case, before any other. This feature is available through `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` on OSX and therefore, mirrord-layer is cross-platform i.e. it works with all Unix-based systems.

And just to have some more context, we are overriding libc functions so that we can replace them with our custom implementation which enables incoming/outgoing traffic and allows us to redirect file read/writes bidirectionally between our local process and the remote pod.
Overriding these libc functions on different systems would have been a difficult task and this is where Frida-gum comes to save the day through its [inline hooking interceptor](https://github.com/frida/frida-gum/blob/main/gum/guminterceptor.h). Read more about Frida [here](https://frida.re/).

Let's go over a quick example of how we can hook the [open](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html) system call by finding and replacing libc symbols through Frida's Rust bindings.

- Get a reference to the `Frida Gum` runtime.

```rs
lazy_static! {
    static ref GUM: Gum = unsafe { Gum::obtain() };
}
```

- Write a detour for `open`.

```rs
unsafe extern "C" fn open_detour(
    name: *const c_char, 
    flags: c_int,
) -> c_int {
    println!("open_detour: {}", std::ffi::CStr::from_ptr(name).to_str().unwrap());
    let res = libc::open(name, flags);
    res
}
```

- Inside the [constructor](https://docs.rs/ctor/latest/ctor/attr.ctor.html) of our shared library:

Create an interceptor.

Find the exported symbol from other shared libraries for `open` and replace it with our detour through our interceptor.

```rs
#[ctor]
fn init() {
    let mut interceptor = Interceptor::obtain(&GUM);
    let open = Module::find_export_by_name(None, "open").unwrap();
    interceptor.replace(open, NativePointer(open_detour as *mut c_void), NativePointer(0 as *mut c_void)).unwrap();
}
```

The complete crate for the example above is available [here](https://github.com/frida/frida-rust/tree/master/examples/gum/hook_open).

After `cargo +nightly build`, let's `LD_PRELOAD` our shared library and run the unix utility called `cat` om our very cool sample file.

```bash
mirrord-user@mirrord:~/mirrord$ LD_PRELOAD=target/debug/libmirrord.so cat file.txt
open_detour: file.txt
boots and cats
```

Awesome! we are able to override the functionality of libc's system call wrappers and replace them with our custom code.

## Mirroring network traffic & web servers üíª

I want to do a quick walkthrough of how a simple webserver would work when run with mirrord and how this led me to find my first bug! So, in general, web servers implement the flow of creating a socket and accepting connections on it by making the following system calls sequentially -  `socket`, `bind`, `listen`, `accept`.
Referring to the notes on the Linux manual for `listen` -

{{<figure src="manpage.png" class="center" height="200" width="1500">}}
We discuss these system calls in detail and how mirrord handles them.

**Note**: These system calls are just an abstraction/wrappers through libc functions that make the system call using the `syscall` instruction to the kernel.

### socket

[socket](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socket.2.html) returns a _socket descriptor_ referring to a communication endpoint. However, in case of a process calling `socket()` being run with mirrord, we do provide similar behavior, but we also need to keep a log of this endpoint in our internal data structure. Now to describe this data structure and what's going on behind the scenes I will refer to this diagram below -

{{<figure src="socket.png" height="100%" width="100%">}}

The function call for `socket` is overridden by mirrord‚Äôs detour replaced through Frida as we discussed in an example before. In this detour, we call libc‚Äôs version of the socket() and store the returned descriptor in a hashmap (called `SOCKETS`) that maps the socket to its related metadata and initialized state. In the end, we return the socket provided by libc, but we had to take that little detour there üòâ.

**Note**: The words ‚Äúhook‚Äù and ‚Äúdetour‚Äù are used interchangeably as they refer to the same idea, but ‚Äúdetour‚Äù is more formal as it is used in the codebase.

### bind

To bind an address to the socket descriptor returned by the `socket` system call, [bind](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bind.2.html) is called. Our detour for bind doesn‚Äôt really do much because all the juicy stuff happens in `listen`. However, here are a few notable things that our detour does do -

- Put the socket in a `Bound` state if it exists in our `SOCKETS` hashmap.
- Check if the port the socket is being bound to is an ignored port.
{{<figure src="bind.png" height="100%" width="100%">}}

**Note**: Ignored port refers to a port that could be used by a debugger or an IDE (which uses sockets). We need to ignore a certain range of ports because mirrord comes with a [VSCode extension](https://mirrord.dev/docs/overview/architecture/#vs-code-extension) that uses debugging support provided by the IDE to run our local process in the context of a remote cluster.

### listen
To start accepting connections on our socket, we have to mark the socket as passive using the [listen](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/listen.2.html) system call. There are quite a few things happening in our ‚Äúlittle‚Äù detour here, so let's take it step by step with the help of a diagram.
{{<figure src="listen.png" height="100%" width="100%">}}

In our detour, notably, the following happen - 

- Change the socket state from `Bound` to `Listening` in our `SOCKETS` hashmap.
- Call libc‚Äôs `bind` with address port as 0, which looks something like `sockaddr_in.port = 0` at a lower level in C. This allows the - OS to assign a port to our address, without us having to check for any available ports.
- Call libc‚Äôs `getsockopt()` to get the port that was assigned to our address. This classifies as our ‚Äúfake port‚Äù.
- Call libc‚Äôs `listen()` to qualify as an endpoint open to accepting new connections.
- Send a message to mirrord-agent that it is listening on the ‚Äúreal port‚Äù.

Well, long story short, mirrord-layer listens on the ‚Äúfake port‚Äù bound to the address specified by the user. For example, if a user calls `bind` on port 80, mirrord-layer will create a port like 3424 and call listen on it by binding the address to it. This also means that we don‚Äôt need `sudo` to run our web server when listening on a special port like 80 since it is never actually bound. And in parallel, mirrord-agent is forwarding traffic to this fake port giving us the illusion that our process is running on the remote pod. We will talk about how mirrord-agent works in another blog post!
