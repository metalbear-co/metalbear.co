"Is mirrord some kind of [ptrace](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html) magic?‚Äù, that‚Äôs what I exactly thought when I was introduced to this idea of ‚Äúmirroring traffic‚Äù. To my surprise, the idea and design behind mirrord are based on simple concepts implemented in a novel way! This is what I want to discuss in this blog post along with my experience as a Junior Engineer learning how to tackle bugs working on this badass project.

## What is mirrord? ü™û

[mirrord](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord) lets you run a local process in the context of a cloud service, which means we can test our code on staging, without actually deploying it there. This leads to shorter feedback loops (you don‚Äôt have to wait on long CI processes to test your code in staging conditions) and a more stable staging environment (since untested services aren‚Äôt being deployed there).  There is a detailed overview of mirrord and what we strive to achieve with it in [this](https://metalbear.co/blog/reintroducing-mirrord/) blog post.

## mirrord-layer + LD_PRELOAD = ‚ù§Ô∏è

mirrord-layer, shipped as a dynamic library, is responsible for ‚Äúoverriding‚Äù or ‚Äúhooking‚Äù libc functions through `LD_PRELOAD`.

### What is `LD_PRELOAD`?

`LD_PRELOAD`[^1], available as an environment variable, is a feature provided by dynamic linkers like [ld.so](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html) that lets us load a shared library into a process before the process loads anything else.
In our case, we use `LD_PRELOAD` to load mirrord-layer, which overrides libc functions with a custom implementation. By overriding file and socket functions, we can then transparently plug the process into the remote pod, having it read and write files and traffic remotely without changing a single line of code.
Overriding these libc functions on different systems would have been a difficult task and this is where Frida-gum comes to save the day through its [inline hooking interceptor](https://github.com/frida/frida-gum/blob/main/gum/guminterceptor.h).

Let's go over a quick example of how we can hook the [open](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html) system call by finding and replacing libc symbols through Frida's Rust bindings.

- Get a reference to the `Frida Gum` runtime.

```rs
lazy_static! {
    static ref GUM: Gum = unsafe { Gum::obtain() };
}
```

- Write a detour for `open`.

```rs
unsafe extern "C" fn open_detour(
    name: *const c_char, 
    flags: c_int,
) -> c_int {
    println!("open_detour: {}", std::ffi::CStr::from_ptr(name).to_str().unwrap());
    let res = libc::open(name, flags);
    res
}
```

- Inside the [constructor](https://docs.rs/ctor/latest/ctor/attr.ctor.html) of our shared library:

Create an interceptor.

Find the exported symbol from other shared libraries for `open` and replace it with our detour through the interceptor.

```rs
#[ctor]
fn init() {
    let mut interceptor = Interceptor::obtain(&GUM);
    let open = Module::find_export_by_name(None, "open").unwrap();
    interceptor.replace(open, NativePointer(open_detour as *mut c_void), NativePointer(0 as *mut c_void)).unwrap();
}
```

The complete crate for the example above is available [here](https://github.com/frida/frida-rust/tree/master/examples/gum/hook_open).

After `cargo +nightly build`, let's `LD_PRELOAD` our shared library and run the unix utility called `cat` on our very cool sample file.

```bash
mirrord-user@mirrord:~/mirrord$ LD_PRELOAD=target/debug/libmirrord.so cat file.txt
open_detour: file.txt
boots and cats

mirrord-user@mirrord:~/mirrord$ echo "look at the statement before "boots and cats" is printed!"
look at the statement before "boots and cats" is printed!
```

Awesome! we are able to override the functionality of libc's system call wrappers and replace them with our custom code.

## Mirroring network traffic & web servers üíª

I want to do a quick walkthrough of how a simple webserver would work when run with mirrord and how this led me to finding my first bug! So, in general, web servers implement the flow of creating a socket and accepting connections on it by making the following system calls sequentially -  `socket`, `bind`, `listen`, `accept`[^2].

Referring to the notes on the Linux manual for [listen](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/listen.2.html#NOTES), we discuss these system calls in detail and how mirrord handles them.

### [1] socket

[socket](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socket.2.html) returns a _socket descriptor_ referring to a communication endpoint. When mirrord hooks a process‚Äô `socket` call,  it maintains that original behavior, but also keeps a record of the new socket in an internal data structure. To describe this data structure and what's going on behind the scenes I will refer to these diagrams below -

- The local process calls `socket`, which then tries to find the `socket` symbol in libc from the shared library dependencies.

{{<figure src="mirrord-process-layer.png" alt="mirrord socket detour" height="100%" width="100%">}}

- Frida‚Äôs interceptor replaced (in-place) the libc‚Äôs socket wrapper with our detour, so the `socket` call goes to our detour üòâ.

{{<figure src="mirrord-libc-intercept.png" alt="mirrord socket detour" height="100%" width="100%">}}

- Inside the detour, we call libc‚Äôs socket wrapper and store the returned descriptor in a hashmap called `SOCKETS` that maps the socket to its related metadata and "initialized" state.

{{<figure src="mirrord-layer-hashmap.png" alt="mirrord socket detour" height="100%" width="100%">}}

```rs
pub(crate) static SOCKETS: LazyLock<Mutex<HashMap<RawFd, Arc<Socket>>>> =
    LazyLock::new(|| Mutex::new(HashMap::new()));
```

- In the end, we just return the socket descriptor returned by the call to libc to the local process.

{{<figure src="mirrord-layer-process.png" alt="mirrord socket detour" height="100%" width="100%">}}

**Note**: The words ‚Äúhook‚Äù and ‚Äúdetour‚Äù are used interchangeably as they refer to the same idea, but ‚Äúdetour‚Äù is more formal as it is used in the codebase.

### [2] bind

To bind an address to the socket descriptor returned by the `socket` system call, [bind](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bind.2.html) is called. Our detour for bind doesn‚Äôt really do much because all the juicy stuff happens in `listen`. However, it puts the socket in a `Bound` state if it exists in our `SOCKETS` hashmap along with the address supplied by the process through the `sockaddr` struct.

{{<figure src="mirrord-bound.gif" alt="mirrord bind image" height="100%" width="100%">}}

Structs for Socket metadata and its states:

```rs
pub struct Socket {
    domain: c_int,
    type_: c_int,
    protocol: c_int,
    pub state: SocketState,
}

pub enum SocketState {
    Initialized,
    Bound(Bound),
    Listening(Bound),
    Connected(Connected),
}
```

### [3] listen

To start accepting connections on our socket, we have to mark the socket as passive using the [listen](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/listen.2.html) system call. There are quite a few things happening in our ‚Äúlittle‚Äù detour here, so let's take it step by with the help of these diagrams below -

- Change the socket state from `Bound` to `Listening` in our `SOCKETS` hashmap.

{{<figure src="mirrord-listen-bound-listening.gif" alt="mirrord listen detour" height="100%" width="100%">}}

- Call libc‚Äôs `bind` with address port as 0, which looks something like `sockaddr_in.port = 0` at a lower level in C. This makes the - OS assign a port to our address, without us having to check for any available ports.
- Call libc‚Äôs `getsockname` to get the port that was assigned to our address. We call this our ‚Äúfake port‚Äù.
- Call libc‚Äôs `listen` to qualify as an endpoint open to accepting new connections.
- Send a message to mirrord-agent, with information including the "real" and "fake" port, that a new "peer" has connected to the agent to receive network traffic on the "real" port.

{{<figure src="mirrord-listen-to-agent.png" alt="mirrord listen detour" height="100%" width="100%">}}

Long story short, mirrord-layer listens on the ‚Äúfake" port bound to the address specified by the user. For example, if a user calls `bind` on port 80, mirrord-layer will create a port like 3424 and call listen on it by binding the address to it. This also means that we don‚Äôt need `sudo` to run our web server when listening on a special port like 80 since it is never actually bound. In parallel, mirrord-agent forwards traffic to this fake port giving us the illusion that our process is running on the remote pod. We will talk about how mirrord-agent works in another blog post!

{{<figure src="mirrord-listen-detour.gif" alt="mirrord listen detour" height="100%" width="100%">}}

### [4] accept

Now we just need to handle new connections! Every time [accept](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/accept.2.html) is called in our local process, we call libc‚Äôs `accept` and get a new socket descriptor referring to that connection/socket passed to `accept`, but that‚Äôs just not it because under the hood we also maintain an internal connection queue for pending connections. This means that every time we receive a new connection request from the agent pod we enqueue that in our `CONNECTION_QUEUE`. Each socket descriptor has its own unique queue.

Furthermore in our detour for `accept`, we do the following -

- Is there a socket in `Listening` state in our `SOCKETS` hashmap, matching the socket passed to the parameters to `accept`?
- If yes, we get the pending connection from our `CONNECTION_QUEUE` for our original socket descriptor.
- Add the new socket descriptor to our `SOCKETS` hashmap in the `Connected` state.
- Modify the pointer to the `sockaddr` struct to implicitly return the address of the new connection.

{{<figure src="mirrord-accept.png" alt="mirrord accept detour" height="100%" width="100%">}}

Alright then, we have all our detours in place. Everything should work smoothly! Or so I thought. Let‚Äôs test it out by rolling back to the commit with only these detours in place.

`git checkout` [d8b4de6](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/tree/d8b4de6f5c5907d4d682f018d42455cd41551eb2)

That‚Äôs the commit before the [patch](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/pull/32) I made for the bug I discovered. We don‚Äôt need to explicitly build and load the agent image in our cluster because the image is already hardcoded in the agent specification. So let‚Äôs get rolling?

```bash
MIRRORD_IMPERSONATED_POD_NAME=http-echo-deployment-77fddcdc49-6z22r LD_PRELOAD=/home/mehula/mirrord/target/debug/libmirrord.so node sample/app.js
```

The YAML file for the http-echo deployment is available [here](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/blob/main/tests/app.yaml).

Let‚Äôs look at some logs of our web server running with mirrord. I won‚Äôt dump all of them here, but I‚Äôll just pick what‚Äôs important. All the logs are available [here](https://gist.github.com/infiniteregrets/4d471f576eb2ff66e44744352f24cb07).

```rust
2022-06-23T20:06:12.011931Z DEBUG mirrord: socket called
2022-06-23T20:06:12.012145Z DEBUG mirrord: bind called

server listening to {"address":""}
2022-06-23T20:06:16.638872Z DEBUG mirrord: send message to client 80
```

Alright, so our web server is up and running, waiting to accept new connections! And just like we talked about the system calls involved before, all of `socket`, `bind`, and `listen` were called. But now let‚Äôs test out if sending a `GET` request to our remote pod mirrors the traffic to our local process.

`curl http://192.168.49.2:32118`

```rust
2022-06-23T20:41:19.082404Z DEBUG mirrord: send message to client 80
2022-06-23T20:41:21.901455Z DEBUG mirrord: new connection id: 0
2022-06-23T20:41:21.901647Z DEBUG mirrord: No socket found for connection_id: 0
events.js:174
      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
      ^

Error: accept EINVAL
    at TCP.onconnection (net.js:1497:24)
Emitted 'error' event at:
    at TCP.onconnection (net.js:1497:10)
```

Looks like even though a connection was enqueued in our `CONNECTION_QUEUE`, it was never dequeued and no new socket descriptor was inserted in our `SOCKETS` hashmap.

**Note**: All references made are in the context of the present version of mirrord, not commit `d8b4de6`.

That is weird, why was accept never called? Let‚Äôs debug our node process and see what‚Äôs going on!

{{<figure src="mirrord-debug-node.gif" alt="mirrord - try to debug node process" height="100%" width="100%">}}

Well, good luck debugging that and I won‚Äôt waste your time trying to figure out how to step into `listen()` and other related functions to look at the underlying function calls. Instead, we will look at the underlying system calls with [strace](https://strace.io/).

Let‚Äôs run the node server with `strace` and send a `GET` request to it.

```bash

It looks like `accept` is never called and the only system call closest to accept we can see on this list is `accept4`. According to the Linux manual page, `accept` and `accept4` are essentially the same except for the `flags` parameter, which we probably don‚Äôt care about right now. So we will hook `accept4` the same way as `accept` and pray that things go well this time.

```bash
2022-06-24T16:22:59.983321Z DEBUG mirrord: accept4 hooked

```

Hah, didn‚Äôt take long for things to south, the exact same error again üòî. We hooked the libc wrapper for `accept4` but it was never called?

Here are a few reasons that I can think of why this could not be working:

- Node is probably into some sorcery and has decided to screw with me this time.
- Maybe Node never even calls accept, but instead something else to accept new connections.

I don‚Äôt believe in sorcery, so I will dig into the second reasoning here.

`strace` only shows us the underlying system calls made by a process. So let‚Äôs do some static analysis and look for some functions similar to `accept` or `accept4`.

I will be using [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) here, a reverse engineering toolkit that comes in super handy when decompiling a binary. So let‚Äôs load our node binary into Ghidra and analyze it!

{{<figure src="mirrord-ghidra-search.png" alt="mirrord - use ghidra to search symbols" height="100%" width="100%">}}

So looks like we won‚Äôt find anything useful unless we import some more relevant shared objects used by our node binary.

{{<figure src="mirrord-ghidra-imports.png" alt="mirrord - use ghidra to find imports" height="70%" width="70%">}}

Finding paths for shared library dependencies can be a bit painful with `find`, so instead, I will use [ldd](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html) here.

```bash
bigbear@metalbear:~/mirrord$ which node

Let‚Äôs start with `libnode` and look for the `accept` like symbols/functions again.

{{<figure src="mirrord-ghidra-accept.png" alt="mirrord - use ghidra to find imports" height="250" width="100%">}}

That gives us some hope! And probably a good lead to follow -

A quick Google search tells me that the `uv__accept` function belongs to `libuv` which is also listed as a node dependency [here](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/meta/topics/dependencies/#dependencies). Let's load `libuv` and carry on our search!

{{<figure src="mirrord-ghidra-uv__accept.png" alt="mirrord - use ghidra to find uv__accept" height="250" width="100%">}}

Here‚Äôs a decompiled version of `uv__accept` which clearly shows it makes calls to either `uv__accept4` or `accept`. We already have our hook for `accept` in place, so we probably don‚Äôt need to worry about that, but let's look into `uv__accept4`.

{{<figure src="mirrord-ghidra-uvdecompile.png" alt="mirrord - use ghidra to check decompilation" height="100%" width="100%">}}

AH! This is it. It all makes sense now. `uv__accept4` is directly making the syscall instead of using the libc wrapper. So let‚Äôs hook `uv__accept4` to behave the same as our hook for `accept/accept4`.

```rs
#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
unsafe extern "C" fn accept4_detour(
    sockfd: i32,
    address: *mut sockaddr,
    address_len: *mut socklen_t,
    flags: i32,
) -> i32 {
    let accept_fd = libc::accept4(sockfd, address, address_len, flags);

    if accept_fd == -1 {
        accept_fd
    } else {
        accept(sockfd, address, address_len, accept_fd)
    }
}
```

Yet another hopeful `GET` request -

`curl http://192.168.49.2:32118`

## Conclusion ü§†

Time to celebrate? Yes! We were finally able to find the correct function to hook and make `accept` work the way want it to work in the context of mirrord.
Writing hooks is not easy - not only does it take an extensive amount of time, but also a ton of research. That's why we try to follow a [feature guide](https://mirrord.dev/docs/developer/new_feature/) which lets us work on new features/hooks based on real use cases and needs so that we don't end up wasting time on something that no one would actually use.

## Credits üêª

On a personal note, these past two months working at MetalBear on mirrord have not only been an amazing learning experience but have also given me a chance to work with some extremely talented engineers and Rust enthusiasts. Just want to take a moment and thank my team for their guidance and mentorship with this little [meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/vdumxo/you_can_do_it_jr_devs/) -
