## About yourself

Bar Hochman, Development Team Lead.

## About your company

Bfore.Ai is like having a crystal ball, we predict if a domain will be a part of attack vector and protect your brand from phishing before it becomes phishing.

## What did you use before?

We read logs and hoped for the best. The best is far away from being there.

## Why did you choose mirrord instead?

Configuring mirrord and using it worked like a magic. I've spared my time debugging a stupid bug and it took me 0.1 second to find the bug (and another 10 seconds to solve the bug , but it's on me). It worked like a charm. Easy to use, just like debugging in my environment. 

## How do you and others in your organization use mirrord?

If something is buggy, we can easily see if the problem is us or the k8s environment (which is also, us). It's easier than using different tools.
