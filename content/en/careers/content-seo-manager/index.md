- Plan and manage an editorial calendar to ensure a steady, consistent pipeline of content across channels.
- Collaborate with freelance writers, teammates, and agency to produce high-quality content including blog posts, case studies, tutorials, and explainers.
- Analyze performance and continuously optimize content efforts based on data and audience insights.

### SEO & GEO

- Create and execute an SEO strategy to grow organic traffic and improve discoverability across search engines.
- Stay ahead of trends in AI-driven search (like Perplexity, ChatGPT, SGE) and build a GEO strategy that accounts for how developers now discover content.
- Monitor key SEO and GEO metrics and implement data-driven improvements to increase reach and relevance.

### Authority & awareness building

- Identify and manage guest posting, link-building, and collaboration opportunities with developer-focused media, newsletters, blogs, and other platforms.
- Support long-term efforts to position MetalBear as a trusted voice in the developer and Kubernetes ecosystem.
- Work closely with product and marketing to surface customer stories and technical insights that showcase our value and impact.

## Requirements

- 3–5+ years of experience in content marketing, ideally for developer or technical audiences.
- Proven track record of creating and scaling content that drives organic growth and engagement.
- Strong understanding of SEO best practices and hands-on experience with tools like Search Console, Ahrefs, or similar.
- Familiarity with emerging trends in search, including AI-generated search experiences and how they impact content discoverability.
- Excellent writing and editing skills with a keen eye for detail.
- Strong communication and collaboration skills.
- Strong problem-solving skills and ability to work independently.

## Preferred  Qualifications

- Familiarity with cloud-native technologies and the Kubernetes ecosystem.
- Experience working with open-source products or in product-led growth (PLG) companies.
