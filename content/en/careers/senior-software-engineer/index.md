## Job Overview

We’re looking for a software engineer with Rust experience to help build and improve mirrord. You’ll work on low-level systems, including OS-level hooks and syscalls, to make cloud development feel as seamless as local development.

## Key Responsibilities

- Design, implement, and maintain core components of mirrord.
- Contribute to low-level features that interact with operating system internals (e.g., hooking, syscall interception).
- Collaborate with the engineering team to develop seamless local-to-cloud development experiences.
- Participate in code reviews, architectural discussions, and sprint planning.
- Triage and fix bugs, improve performance, and address edge cases.
- Engage with the open-source community—triage issues, review contributions, and respond to user feedback.
- Document technical decisions and contribute to internal and external knowledge sharing

## Requirements

- One of the following:
  - 2+ years of professional experience with Rust
  - Experience with OS/low-level programming (hooks, syscalls)
- Good communication skills in English

## Preferred  Qualifications

- Open-source experience
- Kubernetes knowledge
- Strong writing skills (e.g., blog posts, technical articles)..
