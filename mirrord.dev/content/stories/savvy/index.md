## About yourself

Danny Rehelis, DevOps Team Lead at Savvy Security

## About your company

Savvy enables CISOs and security pros to support the safe adoption and use of business SaaS apps, including ChatGPT and other GenAI tools, by providing just-in-time security guardrails that enable users to make better decisions and automate security workflows that orchestrate the response to various events.


## What did you use before?

We explored a wide range of options, including Telepresence, Gefyra, kubefwd and others.

## Why did you choose mirrord instead?

IT JUST WORKS! Out-of-the-box integration experience with our development containers setup directly from VSCode, all with a push of a button.
With straight-forward configuration we successfully eliminated the need for “local-dev” setup, transitioning our entire development workflow to a collaborative “remote-dev” environments.
The ability to intercept real traffic and emulate a remote service locally within the IDE while adding breakpoints and reading/writing data in both directions is an absolute game changer for our developers.
Above all, mirrord is backed by an outstanding group of people @ MetalBear who are incredibly responsive and always ready to engage.

## How do you and others in your organization use mirrord?

We use a homegrown solution that enables developers construct complete replicated environments for testing their code throughout the development process, mirrord utilized daily to troubleshoot end-to-end flows and is the puzzle piece we’ve been missing.
