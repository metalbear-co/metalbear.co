## About yourself

Vergil Zhao, Senior Software Engineer

## About your company

Flexport

## What did you use before?

Previously, we would build the jar file, unpack it, sync the files to the k8s pod, and then repack them into a jar file.

## Why did you choose mirrord instead?

We chose mirrord because it enables us to seamlessly communicate with both remote and local services without the need to unpack, sync, and repack the jar file. This streamlines the process and saves time.

## How do you and others in your organization use mirrord?

My team relies on mirrord to connect our service to remote development environment services, which used to take a long time to establish and wasted valuable resources. With mirrord, we can now utilize local services to reduce connection times while still being able to communicate with remote services. This has significantly improved our development experience, making the team happier and more efficient.
