## About yourself

Roman Yarinovsky, Senior Software Engineer

## About your company

Utila Wallet is an out-of-the-box platform that lets you securely store, transfer and take complete control of your digital assets.

## What did you use before?

Nothing.

## Why did you choose mirrord instead?

Up until this point we did not have remote debugging, mostly because we didn't have the time to invest in implementing a solution, and having mirrord seamlessly integrating into our current environment and allowing us to debug remotely is a game changer for us.
The fact that the setup is so minimalistic, and that it supports a polyglot project, again, seamlessly.

Also important to note it was very simple to set up the VS Code extension and have it running.

## How do you and others in your organization use mirrord?

Usually for remote debugging.
We have scenarios where it might be difficult to reproduce locally, or we don't even know how to reproduce them, and having mirrord helps us with identifying and recreating them as tests.
