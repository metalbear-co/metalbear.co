There are a lot of ways you can contribute to mirrord, like:
- Write code! See our guide [here](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Most of our code is in Rust, but we also have some TypeScript and Kotlin (in our [VS Code](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord-vscode) and [IntelliJ](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord-intellij/pull/24) extensions, respectively), and even some Assembly if you're feeling particularly brave. To start writing code for mirrord, find an issue you'd like to fix or implement in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues). Please let us know that you're working on an issue beforehand, so we can assign it to you, provide help and reduce double-work.
- Report a bug you found in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/issues).
- Suggest a feature or improvement in a discussion on our [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord/discussions).
- Write a blog post about your experience with mirrord. We'd be happy to share it, or even host it on the [MetalBear blog](https://metalbear.co/blog/) - just open a PR with the new post the [MetalBear website repo](https://github.com/metalbear-co/metalbear.co).
- Contribute to our docs and website by sending in a PR to the [mirrord website repo](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord.dev).

Community is at the core of the mirrord project, and we welcome anyone and everyone that wants to join. We mainly hang out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/metalbear) - if you need help or want to chat, feel free to join us there!
