questions:
  - title: "How are seats calculated?"
    content: >
      Seats are calculated by monthly activity. Any user that used mirrord in a calendar month is counted towards your seat count.mirrord identifies users with a unique file it creates on the machine it runs on. If this does not represent distinct users in your organization, or if you use mirrord on cloud workers (e.g. for CI, or cloud development environments), please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>
  - title: "Is there a free version of mirrord?"
    content: >
      Yes! Check out the mirrord OSS <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord">here</a>. You can read more about the differences between the mirrord OSS and mirrord for Teams <a href="https://mirrord.dev/docs/overview/teams/">here</a>.
  - title: "Which plan is right for me?"
    content: >
      Roughly speaking, the Team plan is usually a better choice for teams of under 30 developers, at which point the Enterprise plan becomes a better fit. However, things like support for air-gapped clusters, custom contracts, or higher SLAs can also be deciding factors. If you're not sure, check out the detailed feature list above, or feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> and we'll help you figure it out.
  - title: "Do you offer an enterprise support plan?"
    content: >
      Enteprise support is included in the mirrord for Teams Enterprise plan. As part of our enterprise support, you’ll get our usual support channels as well as a dedicated Microsoft Teams/Slack/Discord channel.
