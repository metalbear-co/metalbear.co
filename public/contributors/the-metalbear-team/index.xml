      <description>&lt;p&gt;KubeCon is one of those huge events where so much is happening, and so much is happening at the same time. If you don&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;plan in advance, you&amp;rsquo;re very likely to miss out on some events that would have been interesting for you. Our first tip&#xA;is: don’t worry too much about missing talks, as all talks will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube shortly after the&#xA;event. Social events, workshops, discussions etc. cannot be caught up later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:54350/blog/mirrord-for-teams-a-step-into-the-remocal-future/mftlaunch.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;      Today we’re excited to announce that after two years of development on mirrord Open Source, our tool that enables Remocal development for Backend engineers, we’re releasing &lt;em&gt;mirrord for Teams&lt;/em&gt; to bring that awesome power to entire Engineering organizations. If you’re new to the term, Remocal development combines the best of both worlds of the dominant modern cloud software engineering paradigms – &lt;em&gt;Remote&lt;/em&gt; development, where you maintain no local environment and everything is cloud dependent, and &lt;em&gt;Local&lt;/em&gt; development, where you develop software on your computer, sync code to staging and production, and test. &lt;em&gt;Remocal&lt;/em&gt; development allows developers to work locally while their process &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; it is running remotely on Staging – and it’s done via a bit of magic we call mirrord. If a tool for shortened software development lifecycles and better collaboration for backend developers, packaged as an enterprise-ready platform with security and governance features included could help you, read on – we think you’ll be very interested in &lt;em&gt;mirrord for Teams&lt;/em&gt;. But first, a bit about how we got there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
