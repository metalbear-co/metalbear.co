      <description>&lt;p&gt;      At MetalBear we build open-source dev tools for backend developers, which puts our domain at the intersection of some pretty interesting topics. There&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of great content being written about things that aren&amp;rsquo;t AI - things like Kubernetes, DevEx, Open Source, Rust, and more - and we go through a lot of it as part of our daily work. How easy it would then be, we collectively thought, to provide our growing community of curious but busy backend developers with a periodic, curated list of our favorite pieces of writing on these topics?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
