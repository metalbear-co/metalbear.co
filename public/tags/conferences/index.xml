      <description>&lt;p&gt;KubeCon is one of those huge events where so much is happening, and so much is happening at the same time. If you don&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;plan in advance, you&amp;rsquo;re very likely to miss out on some events that would have been interesting for you. Our first tip&#xA;is: donâ€™t worry too much about missing talks, as all talks will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube shortly after the&#xA;event. Social events, workshops, discussions etc. cannot be caught up later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
